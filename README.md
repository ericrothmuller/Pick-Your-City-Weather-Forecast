# Pick-Your-City-Weather-Forecast


This project, which I named Pick-Your-City-Weather-Forecast, is part of the 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that can take in multiple cities and display those citie's current weather information along with the future 5 day forecast for those cities. The UV Index will also change color depending on the severity of the UV Index (High, Moderate, and Low).
